I have used some pretty old cameras, but never anything close to one hundred years old. So, I set myself the challange of using and producing photos with a one hundred year old camera.

My initial camera choice was a Kodak 3A folding camera. Unfortunately that was not to be. The camera never arrived.

My next choice was the ICA Llotd 510.
