The Asahi Optical Co made the Super-Takumar 135mm f3.5 lens in the 60s and 70s for Pentax M42 screw mount cameras. Several variations were produced during that period, the only difference being the coating applied to the glass. The Super-Multi-Coated version (the one you see here) was the last.

Asahi made quality lenses and the Takumar range was legendary for their build quality. Even after all these years, the aperture and focus rings are buttery smooth and precise.
