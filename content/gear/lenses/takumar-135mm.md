> The 135mm f3.5 Takumar is a medium telephoto lens made by the Asahi Optical Company. Many consider it one of the best vintage telephoto lenses available.

## A brief history

The Asahi Optical Co (later known as Pentax) made the Super-Takumar 135mm f3.5 lens in the 60s and 70s for Pentax M42 screw mount cameras. Several variations were produced during that period, the only difference being the coating applied to the glass. The Super-Multi-Coated version (the one you see here) was the last.

Asahi made quality lenses, and the Takumar range was legendary for its build quality. Even after all these years, the aperture and focus rings are buttery smooth and precise.

- **Optical Performance:** The lens typically offers good sharpness, especially when stopped down a bit from its widest aperture. It can produce pleasing images with good contrast and colour rendition.
- **Build Quality:** Like other lenses in the Super-Takumar series, the 135mm lens features solid construction with metal components, making it durable and long-lasting.
- **Bokeh:** The lens can produce smooth background blur (bokeh), particularly when used at wider apertures, which is desirable for isolating subjects and creating a sense of depth in photographs.
- **Versatility:** A 135mm focal length is well-suited for a variety of photographic subjects, including portraits, wildlife, and sports photography. It provides a moderate telephoto reach that can help isolate subjects and compress perspective.
