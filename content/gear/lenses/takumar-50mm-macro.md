> The Super-Takumar Super-Multi-Coated Macro Takumar 50mm f4 lens is a metal body macro lens capable of 1:2 macro reproduction.

## Brief history
The Super-Takumar Super-Multi-Coated Macro Takumar 50mm f4 lens was produced by the Asahi Optical Company (later known as Pentax) in the 1960s and 1970s. The Super-Takumar series of lenses was known for its excellent optical quality and solid construction.

Several variants were produced. The first Macro-Takumar was constructed differently from the later variants and had a 1x magnification. The subsequent variants had the same optics and 0.5x magnification.

The following information is for the lens I used: the latest model and version.
