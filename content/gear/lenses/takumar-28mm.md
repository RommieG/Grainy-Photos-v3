> In the 1960s and 1970s, the Super-Takumar 28mm f/3.5 lens provided photographers with a wide-angle option that produced quality results. Its simplicity and reliability continue to make it a favourite among photographers who appreciate vintage glass.

## Brief history

The Asahi Optical Co made the Super-Takumar 28mm f3.5 lens between 1962 and 1975 for Pentax M42 screw mount cameras. Two different models were released with different optics. Also, the earlier model had a 58mm filter size and went to an aperture size of f22, whereas the later model had a 49mm filter size and a minimum aperture of f16.

The following information is for the lens I used: the latest model and version, the Super-Multi-Coated variant (as seen on this page), produced from 1971 to 1975.

## Conclusion

With a maximum aperture of f3.5, this is not the fastest lens. However, for landscape photography, where you want a greater depth of field, this does not matter. The lens is sharp and contrasty and works well for my black-and-white film photography. I use it with a [Pentax Spotmatic film camera](/gear/cameras/asahi-spotmatic/).

Plus, this lens is a joy to use with the famous Takumar build quality and buttery smooth focusing ring.
