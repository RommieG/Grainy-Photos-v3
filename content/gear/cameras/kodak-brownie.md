The 620 film box cameras were made of sheet metal by Kodak Ltd in England. Several generations were produced, the Kodak Six-20 Brownie E was made between 1947-53.

The camera uses 620 film. Although the actual film is the same as 120 film, the 620 spools are slightly shorter and have a smaller diameter. Although it is possible to cut down a spool of 120 film to fit, the preferred option is to re-spool 120 film onto 620 spools.

The lens is a single meniscus fixed focus F/11, 100 mm focal length, with an additional sliding portrait lens which focuses between 3 and 6 feet. There is also a yellow filter which can be slid in front of the lens.

The camera has a rotary shutter with two speeds, B and 1/60 of a second.
