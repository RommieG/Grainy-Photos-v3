> The Nikon FE2 is often regarded as one of the best 35mm film SLR cameras ever manufactured, renowned for its exceptional build quality, reliability, user-friendliness, and, above all, its ability to deliver outstanding photographic results.

## A brief history of the Nikon FE2

The Nikon FE2 is a classic 35mm film SLR camera produced by Nikon from 1983 to 1987. It was introduced as an enhanced version of the popular Nikon FE, retaining many of its predecessor’s design elements while incorporating significant improvements.

Key enhancements included a faster maximum shutter speed of 1/4000 seconds compared to the FE’s 1/1000 second, as well as an improved metering system designed to provide more accurate readings, particularly in challenging lighting conditions.

The FE2 was part of a transitional period in photography when cameras became more electronically controlled but still maintained a connection to the manual, mechanical roots of earlier SLRs. It’s often seen as a perfect balance between the old and the new, embodying the transition from mechanical to more modern, electronic cameras.
Production of the Nikon FE2 ceased in 1987 with the introduction of the Nikon FM2n, which offered even more robust mechanical features and reaffirmed Nikon’s commitment to the professional 35mm SLR market.

### Interchangeable lenses
The FE2 is compatible with the entire Nikon F-mount lens system, enabling it to utilise a diverse array of lenses from Nikon and third-party manufacturers, spanning the spectrum from wide-angle to telephoto to macro.
