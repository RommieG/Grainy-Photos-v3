The Pentax MX was a 35 mm single-lens reflex camera produced by Asahi Optical Co, between 1976 and 1985. It was one of the smallest SLRs ever manufactured. 

The MX was solidly built, and featured a fully mechanical construction, including a mechanical horizontal cloth shutter. Shutter speeds ranged from 1-1/1000 sec plus B. Only the light metering system was dependent on batteries. The MX is all manual: it does not feature autofocus or autoexposure modes. It used the K lens mount.
