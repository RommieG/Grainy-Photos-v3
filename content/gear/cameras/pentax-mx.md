> I have a particular soft spot for this camera as it was the first SLR camera I ever bought. I purchased it in 1976 and have it to this day; the photos on this page are of that very same camera. It is still in perfect working order.

The Pentax MX is a classic 35 mm single-lens reflex camera produced by Asahi Optical Co between 1976 and 1985. It was one of the smallest SLRs ever manufactured.

The MX was solidly built and featured a fully mechanical construction, including a mechanical horizontal cloth shutter. Shutter speeds ranged from 1-1/1000 sec plus B. Only the light metering system was dependent on batteries. Exposure is indicated in the viewfinder by a series of green, amber and red  LEDs. In bright sunlight, I find these difficult to see. That is my only real gripe about this camera.

The MX is all manual: it does not feature autofocus or autoexposure modes. Therefore, it does not require batteries to operate (except for the light meter).

Like on most SLRs, the lens can be changed. It used the K lens mount.

Overall, the Pentax MX is a highly regarded film camera cherished by photographers for its simplicity, reliability, and excellent image quality. Its compact size and full manual control make it a popular choice for beginners and experienced photographers. It is an excellent camera for learning photography.
