> El Torcal de Antequera is a Park Natural, approximately 17 square kilometres, in the municipality of Antequera, about 30 km north of Malaga. It is an area of outstanding natural beauty and arguably has the best examples of karst limestone formation in Europe.

## El Torcal walking routes

El Torcal is accessible by vehicle, the best access point being the Torcal Alto Visitor Center. The Natural Park has several official trails for public use. I followed the yellow route, which starts and ends at the Visitor Center. It is approximately 3 km long through the Torcal Alto, with beautiful panoramic views. 

## Film photo details

I took all the photos on this page using a Mamiya M645 1000S camera with Ilford HP5 rated at 200 ISO. Developer: Spur Acurol-N 1+50.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

This location was very remote, and I had problems getting the GPS coordinates for the photo locations; some are missing, and some are not very accurate, but they are in the right general area.

Film roll No 315
