> Andalucia, Spain, boasts a diverse range of wildflowers due to its varied landscapes, including mountains, plains, and coastal areas. The spring wildflower display has been poor in the past few years due to hot and dry conditions. However, the moon and stars must have aligned this year, and the spring wildflower display in Andalicia is stunning and prolific.

Some common wildflowers in Andalucia include Spanish lavender, broom, rockrose, oleander, marigold, iris, bluebell, field poppy, and hundreds, probably thousands more.

I like nothing more than wandering around and taking photos of these wonderful flowers. So, let's cut to the chase and look at the photos. However, please be aware: I am not a botanist, and my flower identification skills are hopeless. I do not want to misinform by incorrectly identifying plants, so I posted most photos without identification.

One indisputable thing is that the flowers are beautiful. I hope you enjoy the photos as much as I enjoyed taking them.

## Almonds

Although almond blossom is not technically a wildflower, it is beautiful and flowers in late January and February. The almond blossoms have long gone, but plentiful green almonds have replaced them. These will turn brown, and the outer hull (exocarp) will split, revealing the inner shell (endocarp) with the seed we are familiar with. 

Here are a couple of bonus photos of green almonds:

## Film photo details

I took all the photos on this page using a Pentax MX camera with Kodak Gold film. I home-developed the film using a Tetnal Colourtec C41 kit at 30C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using SmartConvert and Capture One software.

Film roll No 384.
