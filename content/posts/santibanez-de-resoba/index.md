> Santibáñez de Resoba in Palencia, Castilla y León nestles in the Estrecho valley at the foot of hills and mountains, approximately 13 km from Cervera de Pisuerga. It is famous for the church of San Cristóbal, located at the very southern edge of the village.

## Santibáñez de Resoba - a chance find
I was returning from the [Gigante del Valle Estrecho walk](https://grainyphotos.com/posts/senda-del-gigante/) when I saw an interesting old church. So I pulled over to take a look. 

The church comprises a single nave with a Romanesque belfry dating back to the late 13th century. Unfortunately, the church was closed, but I learned that the presbytery is covered with a ribbed vault, and the main altarpiece is baroque, with an image of a crucified Christ from the 17th century. Information from Wikipedia – [Santibáñez de Resoba](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez_de_Resoba) (2024, December 11).

Next to the church was a small cemetery. A little further away was an abandoned row of terraced houses. What a great photo opportunity!

## Film photo details

I took all the photos using a Nikon FE2 camera with Ilford Delta 100 film. Developer: Ilfotec LC-29 1+29 – developed for 7.5 minutes @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

Film roll No's 264
