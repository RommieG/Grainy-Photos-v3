> Harman Phoenix 200 is a new colour C41 negative film with high contrast, strong grain, vibrant colours, halation and unmistakably analogue. I bought three rolls to test. This blog post covers the second roll.

My [first roll of Phoenix 200](/posts/harman-phoenix-200/) was fairly successful. Rather than shooting more of the same type of photos, I thought a change of scene would be good to see how the film works in different environments. So I packed my bags and headed for a day out in the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y las Villas. If you don't know where that is, the GPS location links under the photos will show you exactly where the photos were taken.

Below is every photo from my second roll of Harman Phoenix 200 film: the good, the bad and the ugly. You can judge for yourselves.

## Film photo details

I took all the photos on this page using a [Pentax MX](/gear/cameras/pentax-mx/) camera with Harman Phoenix 200 film rated at 133 ISO. Aperture and shutter settings are provided below every photo. I developed the film using a Tetenal ColorTec C41 kit for 9 minutes @30C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using SmartConvert and Capture One software.
