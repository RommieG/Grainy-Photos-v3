> The Government of Andalucia declared Pinar de Cánavas a natural monument of biotic character in November 2001.

Pinar de Cánavas is a pine forest of approximately 5 hectares in the Sierra Mágina, Spain, which has largely been unaffected by human intervention. It comprises some 120 specimens of mostly Aleppo pine, with an average age of more than 200 years and several majestic specimens of more than 250 years. Young pines typically have straight trunks and conical canopies; however, these aged pines have twisted trunks and umbrella-shaped canopies, typical of old pine trees.

The forest is an ideal habitat for hundreds of species of flora and fauna, including the love dove and the Bonelli eagle.

## Hiking

There is a signposted hiking trail through the forest, which can be incorporated to include other places of interest, such as Los Caracoles and the Graja cave, known for its cave paintings. Due to the altitude and location, the area of Pinar de Cánavas offers wide-reaching panoramic views of the Sierra Mágina Mountains and nearby villages.


## Film photo details

I took all the photos using a [Pentax Spotmatic](/gear/cameras/asahi-spotmatic/) camera with Kentmere 100 film, rated at 64 ISO. I developed the film in Spur Acurol-N, diluted 1+70, for 9 min @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

Film roll No. 362
