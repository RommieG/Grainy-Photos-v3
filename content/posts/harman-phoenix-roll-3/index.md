> Harman Phoenix 200 is a new colour C41 negative film with high contrast, strong grain, vibrant colours, halation and unmistakably analogue. I bought three rolls to test. This blog post covers the third, and for now, the final roll of Phoenix 200.

My [first roll of Phoenix 200](/posts/harman-phoenix-200/) was fairly successful. The [second roll](https://grainyphotos.com/posts/harman-phoenix-roll-2/) I shot in the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y las Villas. I think that was mostly OK.

In order to mix things up a bit, I went for a day on the coast, near Motril in Southern Spain. If you donâ€™t know where that is, the GPS location links under the photos will show you exactly where the photos were taken. I thought it would be interesting to see how the film copes with a very bright environment with plenty of blues.

## Film photo details

I took all the photos on this page using a [Pentax MX](/gear/cameras/pentax-mx/) camera with Harman Phoenix 200 film rated at 133 ISO. Aperture and shutter settings are provided below every photo. I developed the film using a Tetenal ColorTec C41 kit for 9 minutes @30C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using SmartConvert and Capture One software.

Below is every photo from my third roll of Harman Phoenix 200 film: the good, the bad and the ugly. I think these are some of the best photos I have taken using the film.
