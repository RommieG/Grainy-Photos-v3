> Genalguacil is a classic Andalusian white town with a difference. In its small squares and cobbled streets of Arab origin, there are works of contemporary art from known artists from around the world.

## Location

Genalguacil is located in the heart of the Genal Valley, one of the most unspoiled places in Andalucia, Southern Spain. It is approximately 45 km from Ronda, at an altitude of 590 m and surrounded by chestnut forests. It is of typical Moorish or Andalucian Architecture and is the best-preserved in the area. It is one of the prettiest villages in Spain – “pueblos más bonitos de España”.

## Genalguacil pueblo museo

The main attraction of this town is that it is that every two years in August, some of the most famous artists come here to make art in the streets. This is then permanently exhibited in the streets, squares, walls and roofs of the town. Genalguacil has become a “pueblo museo”, an open-air museum or art gallery. This makes walking through the cobbled streets of the town so interesting. You find paintings on walls, sculptures, carved trunks and much more. Artwork which is not resistant to the weather is displayed in the local ‘Fernando Centeno López’ Contemporary Art Museum. This art gallery also features other exhibitions throughout the year. Genalguacil also has a Crafts Centre which supports traditional local handicrafts.

## St. Peter the Martyr of Verona church

The parish church of St. Peter, the Martyr of Verona, is the most notable of Genalguacil’s buildings, with its characteristic octagonal tower from the 18th century of academic baroque and classicist style with touches of Mudejar style. Although its first construction dates from the 16th century, it was destroyed during the Moorish rebellion of 1570 and rebuilt as early as the 18th century. The main structure comprises three naves separated by semicircular arches.

## Film photo details

I used two vintage film cameras for my photo walk around Genalgaucil, a Pentax Spotmatic SP and a Zeiss Ikon Ikoflex IIa 855/19, both with Kentmere 100 film exposed @ 64 ISO. Developer: Spur Acurol-N 1+70 9 min @20C

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

Film roll No’s 358, 359 and 361.
