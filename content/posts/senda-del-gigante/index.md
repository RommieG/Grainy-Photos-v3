> The Senda del Gigante del Valle Estrecho (Trail of the Estrecho Valley Giant) is an easy 4.4 km walk culminating at the Mirador de Peña Albilla.

The walk starts at a car park on the P-210 near Santibañez de Resoba.

The route ascends through mountain meadows with views of Peña Negra, Sierra de Peña Labra and Pico Tres Mares. After a little over 2 km, the path reaches the Mirador de Peña Albilla with beautiful far-reaching views. At the Mirador, a panel describes the legend of the Estrecho Valley giant.

The return to the car park is along the same path, although a few minor detours are possible.

## Legend of the giant of the Estrecho Valley

Legend tells us that in the distant past, a colossal man resided in the Estrecho Valley near San Martín de los Herreros. He had a daughter who lived with him and he loved her dearly. However, one fateful day, the daughter met a man and fell deeply in love with him. Together, they embarked on a journey south along the roads leading to La Valdavia.

Upon discovering his daughter had left, the giant was overcome with profound sadness. In his despair, he lay down on the mountain range of La Peña and succumbed to a deep sleep from which he never awoke.

It is said that the silhouette of the giant can still be seen from certain viewpoints.
