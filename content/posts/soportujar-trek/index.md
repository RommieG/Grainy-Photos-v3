> A spectacular walk high above Soportújar with stunning views. The walk's highlight was the 30 m waterfall on the Chico River.

In April, I spent a day in and around Soportújar, a municipality in the Alpujarra region of the province of Granada, in the Sierra Nevada Natural Park, Spain. I split the day into two: half a day for a walk above Soportújar and the rest to [explore the village of Soportújar](https://grainyphotos.com/posts/soportujar/) itself. This post is about the walk.

## Walk statistics

Distance walked: Approximately 11 km.  
Cumulative height gain: 450m.  
Difficulty: Moderate.

## Film photo details

I took all but one of the photos on this page using a Nikon FE2 camera with Nikkor 35-105 zoom. 

Film: Ilford Delta 100  
Developer: Spur Acurol-N 1+70 @20C for 8.5 minutes @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

## The first part of the walk

The first part of the walk (about 3 km) was a steep uphill slog along a concrete path. It was hard going, but the views were stunning. I called this post “a stroll above Soportújar”, but the first part was anything but.

It was a beautiful spring day, and the wildflowers were prolific.

## The middle part of the walk

Once the trail levelled off, the walk was stunning. A meandering dirt track through a pine forest with glimpses of the Sierra Nevada mountain, with a dusting of snow.

The walk's highlight was the Río Chico waterfall and the dam structure; for some strange reason, it is known simply as Dique (dam) 24. The dam is a 30 m structure built in 1943 to stabilise the adjacent slopes. It is an imposing structure. In the last few years, 642,000 euros has been spent on repair and maintenance.

## The descent back to Soportújar

The final part of the walk was along an acequia (irrigation ditch). The path by the acequia was narrow and precarious in places, with the acequia on the left and a sheer drop on the right.

After that, it was a steep descent along a concrete path back down to Soportújar.
