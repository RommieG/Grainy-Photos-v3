> Jubrique, located in the province of M√°laga, Andaluc√≠a, southern Spain, is one of the most picturesque white villages in Spain. Its streets and houses are harmoniously adapted to the surrounding serran√≠a, featuring narrow, steep streets and whitewashed houses.

Jubrique is one of my favourite white villages. Its allure remains undiminished, and I have visited it on numerous occasions, each time finding solace in its captivating beauty, a testament to its enduring charm.

During my most recent visit in the late summer of 2023, I captured its essence through these photographs, taken on a Sunday morning during the fiesta weekend, showing an unusual tranquillity in the village with its inhabitants having a lie-in following a long night of partying.


## Film photo details

I took all the photos using a Pentax Spotmatic camera with Kentmere 100 film. Developer: Ilfotec LC-29, 1+19, for 6 minutes @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

Film roll No 360

## About Jubrique

Jubrique is a town in the province of M√°laga, Andalucia, in southern Spain. The town is located at an altitude of 560 metres above sea level, 38 kilometres from Ronda and 105 from Malaga.

Jubrique is a quiet place, ‚Äúout of the way,‚Äù accessed by narrow roads through scenic wooded countryside. With fewer than a thousand inhabitants. It is a great place to visit.

### Churches in Jubrique

The most important building in the town is undoubtedly the parish church of San Francisco de Assisi, whose construction began in the 16th or 17th century. It has undergone several renovations, the last of them in 1970. The building is rectangular, and over time, the tower was added in the 18th century, and the head and the transept were completed in the 19th century. The church houses several interesting images in polychrome wood made in the 18th century, including that of St. Francis of Assisi, a Nazarene and the Virgen de la Candelaria.

The municipality has two other churches, the Hermitage of Santa Cruz del Choricillo and the Hermitage of Casta√±uelo.

### Wines and spirits

The area has a long tradition in the production of wines and spirits. Jubrique was one of the most important wine producers in the XVIII century, with up to sixty liquor factories. A pot still symbol is often used as a kind of logo and decoration on walls and doors. An old still is located behind the church.

### Hiking in the area

Jubrique is located in the Genal Valley, an area of outstanding beauty with hills and a wooded landscape. The location is ideal for hiking, and there is an extensive network of hiking trails through the countryside (such as the Sendero Los Saucillos walk) and to nearby towns, like Genalgaucil.
