The focal point of the town is its seafront promenade, Balcón de Europa, with views of the Mediterranean and surrounding mountains. It hosts popular summertime concerts and a variety of street performers. It’s the ideal place to meet friends, go for a stroll and enjoy drinks and tapas on a balmy summer evening.

The old part of the town is very Andalucian, with its terraced white houses and pebbled streets. You can spend many hours wandering the narrow streets browsing the local shops for local products.
