The Cross Pantano del Víboras, organised and promoted by Sport Maniacs in collaboration with Martos Council, is an annual event held in late February or early March. This year’s ninth edition took place on February 23rd. The sporting event has gained popularity, and this year was the best yet, with over 1,500 participants and bringing together more than 3,000 people.

## The course

The event features a race around the Viboras Reservoir, a 14.5-kilometre route that includes 11 kilometres of dirt tracks and 4 kilometres of asphalt. The route is mostly flat, except for a slight elevation near the dam.

## The event

In addition to the running race, there’s also a hiking category and a shorter race for children. This event is perfect for families.

The race begins at the Plaza de la Constitución in Las Casillas. An interesting feature is that the hiking and running events take place on the same course. Hikers start first, going anticlockwise, while runners follow later, running clockwise. This means that runners and walkers pass each other on the course, which I find wonderful.

I participated in the hiking category, which was my sixth time. At 9:30, we set off. I was accompanied by my dog, Flo, my Olympus XA camera loaded with Fomapan 100 film, and over 600 other hikers. I captured the following photos during my hike around the course and in the village afterwards.

I love this event. The route is incredibly picturesque, traversing unique and spectacular landscapes. The high turnout creates a fantastic sense of camaraderie and a lively party/carnival atmosphere. After the event, people gather in the streets outside the two village bars, enjoying food and drinks for hours.

## Film photo details

I took all the photos on this page using an Olympus XA camera with Fomapan 100 film. Developer: Rodinal, 1+50, for 9 minutes @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Zf mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.
