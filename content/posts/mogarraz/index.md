> Mogarraz is one of my favourite villages in Spain; I have been there at least three times. It has plenty of history, is very picturesque, has a great location, and oozes charm. Read on to find out more… 

Mogarraz is a small, picturesque village in the province of Salamanca, situated in the autonomous community of Castile and León in north-western Spain. It is nestled in the Sierra de Francia mountain range within the natural park known as Las Batuecas-Sierra de Francia. It is approximately 80 kilometres southwest of the city of Salamanca.

## The history of Mogarraz

Mogarraz’s history stretches back centuries, with evidence of human settlement dating back to prehistoric times. The village has witnessed various periods of Roman, Visigothic, and Moorish rule throughout history.

During the Middle Ages, Mogarraz was part of the Kingdom of León and later became a strategic location in the struggle between Christians and Muslims during the Reconquista. The village eventually came under Christian control in the 12th century.

In the centuries that followed, Mogarraz experienced periods of prosperity and decline, influenced by factors such as agriculture, trade, and conflicts. Its economy relied mainly on agriculture, forestry, and livestock.

## Architecture

 Mogarraz does have a distinct charm and historical character due to its traditional architecture, which reflects its long history, with some structures dating back to the medieval period.

Narrow streets, well-preserved stone houses and historic buildings characterise the village’s layout.

## Tourism

Mogarraz has become known for its cultural heritage and tourism. Visitors are drawn to Mogarraz for several reasons: 
- Historical and Cultural Attractions, including landmarks such as the Church of San Martín, the Plaza Mayor, and the ethnographic museum.
- Outdoor Activities: Mogarraz is situated in the picturesque Sierra de Francia mountain range and offers outdoor activities such as hiking, nature walks, and birdwatching in the countryside.
- The "Las Caras de Mogarraz" project (more details below), featuring portraits painted on the facades of houses, has garnered attention and become a unique attraction.
- Local Cuisine and Festivals.

## Las Caras de Mogarraz

Recently, Mogarraz gained attention for an art project called "Las Caras de Mogarraz" (The Faces of Mogarraz), where portraits of villagers were painted on the facades of houses, creating a unique outdoor art gallery.

The inspiration for the project came from old photographs found in the village archives featuring residents of Mogarraz from the early 20th century. Maillo decided to create large-scale paintings based on these photographs and then display them on the facades of the houses where the depicted individuals had once lived.

The project has revitalised the village by turning it into an outdoor art gallery, attracting tourists and art enthusiasts. It also preserves the memory of Mogarraz's past inhabitants and contributes to the sense of community identity. 

## Film photo details

I used two different film cameras to take the photos on this page:

- A Mamiya M645 1000S with Ilford FP4 film. Developer: Ilfotec LC29, 1+19, for 7 minutes 30 seconds @20C.
- A Nikon FE2 with Ilford Delta 100 film. Developer: Ilfotec LC29, 1+29, for 7 minutes 30 seconds @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

The photos were taken throughout the old quarters of Mogarraz. Let's take a wander and explore...
