> Torre de La Harina is near Sabriego, in the municipality of
Alcaudete. The name translates as “Flour Tower”. Why it so-
called is a mystery to me as it is generally considered to have
been a watchtower.

This is a great walk for the dogs. I park up at the Paraje del Puente Palomillas, which is
a nice picnic spot by the San Juan river. The walk to the tower is through a pleasant
pine forest. The last part of the walk is quite steep, but the views are excellent once
you reach the top.

The tower is cylindrical and of masonry construction, approximately 4.5 m in
diameter. It is in a poor state of repair, as can be seen in the photographs.

## Film photo details

I took all the photos using a Zeiss Ikon Ikoflex IIa 855/16 camera with Ilford HP5 film exposed at 400 ISO. Developer: Ilford Ilfotec LC29, 1+19, for 6,5 minutes @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

I shot the photos mid-morning with bright sunlight and clear blue skies.
