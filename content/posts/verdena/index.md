> Verdeña is a village in the Montaña Palentina region, 15 km from Cervera de Pisuerga. Known for its El Bosque Fósil walk, Verdeña stands at an altitude of about 1239 m.

## Film photo details

On my day in Verdeña and the El Bosque Fósil (the fossil forest) walk I took all the photos using a Nikon FE2 camera with Ilford Delta 100 film. Developer: Ilfotec LC-29 1+29, developed for 7.5 minutes @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Z6 mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One software.

Film roll No's 266 and 268

## About Verdeña

At the village’s entrance, a spacious car park provides ample parking for residents and visitors alike; only residents are permitted vehicular access into the village itself. The village retains its charming character, featuring a blend of historic traditional houses, including an old forge and a traditional laundry washhouse that harkens back to bygone eras.

## San Miguel Church

The parish church of San Miguel is an excellent example of the transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture. Inside is an image of Saint Michael, the village’s patron saint. The Verdeña festival was celebrated on the day of the patron archangel, September 29, but has recently moved to August 13.

## El Bosque Fósil (the fossil forest)

El Bosque Fósil de Verdeña (The Fossil Forest of Verdeña) is a remarkable paleontological site located near the village of Verdeña. This unique fossil forest together with the hiking trail offers a fascinating blend of natural history, geology, and scenic beauty.

The Fossil Forest is a notable geological site that showcases fossilized remains of an ancient forest. Visitors can witness petrified trunks and remnants of colossal trees that once constituted a prehistoric tropical ecosystem. The fossils date back to the Carboniferous period, approximately 300 million years ago, during which much of the present-day European continent was submerged under dense, swampy forests. Over time, the plant matter was subjected to layers of sediment, leading to fossilization through the application of high pressure and mineralization.

### El Bosque Fósil walk

A popular activity for visitors is the hiking route that leads to the Fossil Forest and continues through the stunning natural landscapes near Verdeña.

The walk is clearly signposted, beginning and finishing in the village of Verdeña. The route is approximately 3-4 kilometres (1-2 hours), making it an accessible and family-friendly hike. 

Starting from the car park at the entrance to the village, walk past the church and follow the signposted path out of the village. After a long ascent through an oak forest with many old trees, you reach a pit with a cliff face where you can see imprints of the fossilised trees.
