> Cómpeta is a charming town in the Axarquía region of the Málaga province in southern Spain. Nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Almijara mountains, it's part of the picturesque "White Villages" (Pueblos Blancos) that dot this area. Cómpeta is renowned for its traditional Andalusian architecture, narrow cobblestone streets, whitewashed houses, and stunning views of the surrounding countryside and the Mediterranean Sea in the distance.

## Film photo details

I took all the photos on this page using a [Mamiya M645](/gear/cameras/mamiya-m645/) camera with Kentmere film. Developer: Rodinal/Adonal, 1+50, for 15 minutes @20C.

The photos were digitised using a Nikon Zf mirrorless digital camera with a Tokina AT-X Pro Macro 100mm f2.8 D lens and processed using Capture One and DXO Photolab software.

Film roll No 434.
